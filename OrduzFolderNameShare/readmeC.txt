The works of American author Edgar Allan Poe 
(January 19, 1809 â€“ October 7, 1849) include many poems, 
short stories, and one novel. His fiction spans 
multiple genres, including horror fiction, 
adventure, science fiction, and detective fiction, 
a genre he is credited with inventing.
\These works are generally considered part 
of the Dark romanticism movement, a literary 
reaction to Transcendentalism. Poe's writing 
reflects his literary theories: he disagreed with didacticism and allegory.
Meaning in literature, he said in his criticism, 
should be an undercurrent just beneath the surface; 
works whose meanings are too obvious cease to be art.
