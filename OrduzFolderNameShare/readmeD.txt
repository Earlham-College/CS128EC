Les Miserables is a French historical novel by Victor Hugo, 
first published in 1862, that is considered one of 
the greatest novels of the 19th century. 
Les Miserables has been popularized through 
numerous adaptations for film, television and 
the stage, including a musical.

In the English-speaking world, the novel is 
usually referred to by its original French 
title. However, several alternatives have been 
used, including The Miserables, The Wretched, 
The Miserable Ones, The Poor Ones, The Wretched 
Poor, The Victims, and The Dispossessed.
Beginning in 1815 and culminating in the 1832 
June Rebellion in Paris, the novel follows the 
lives and interactions of several characters, 
particularly the struggles of ex-convict Jean Valjean and his experience of redemption.[6]
